# Image Display Logic Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Dashboard Header Display Issue
**Problem**: When clicking Tech Stack or QR Code buttons, the dashboard header ("TracktionAi Analytics Dashboard") and data summary were still being displayed above the images.

**Solution**: Moved the image-only display logic to be the very first thing in the main content area, before the header is rendered:
- Image display logic now comes immediately after sidebar setup and before `st.title()`
- Added `st.stop()` after image and back button to prevent any dashboard content from rendering
- Both Tech Stack and QR Code now show ONLY the image and back button

### 2. Indentation Errors
**Problem**: Multiple `elif` statements had incorrect indentation causing Python compilation errors.

**Solution**: Fixed indentation for all analysis view conditions:
- `elif selected_analysis == "🌍 Regional Analysis":`
- `elif selected_analysis == "👥 Demographics":`  
- `elif selected_analysis == "🎵 Music Trends":`
- `elif selected_analysis == "📊 Engagement Metrics":`
- `elif selected_analysis == "🤖 TracktionAi Chat":`

### 3. Image Path Optimization
**Problem**: Tech Stack image was using relative path `../TechStack.png`

**Solution**: Updated to use local path `TechStack.png` since both images exist in the dashboard directory.

## Code Structure
```python
# Sidebar setup and buttons
# Image display logic (FIRST - before any dashboard content)
if st.session_state.get('show_tech_stack', False):
    # Show only tech stack image and back button
    st.stop()  # Prevent dashboard rendering
elif st.session_state.get('show_qr_code', False):
    # Show only QR code image and back button  
    st.stop()  # Prevent dashboard rendering

# Dashboard header and content (only shown if no image is active)
st.title("🎧 TracktionAi Analytics Dashboard")
# ... rest of dashboard content
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ Dashboard starts without compilation errors
- ✅ All analysis views load correctly
- ✅ Tech Stack button shows ONLY the image and back button
- ✅ QR Code button shows ONLY the image and back button
- ✅ No flickering when switching between views
- ✅ Back buttons properly return to dashboard

## Files Modified
- `/Users/iara/Projects/Zippotify_Datapipe/static-dashboard/dashboard.py`

## Final Status
The TracktionAI Analytics Dashboard now correctly displays Tech Stack and QR Code images in full-screen mode without any dashboard header or data summary interference.
