## Data Sources

The dashboard uses data generated by the **comprehensive ETL pipeline** (`etl/aggregated_data.py`):

### Input Data (EventSim Format)
- `auth_events_head.jsonl` (10,000 authentication events)
- `listen_events_head.jsonl` (50,000 listening events)
- `page_view_events_head.jsonl` (20,000 page views)
- `status_change_events_head.jsonl` (4,159 status changes)

### Generated Analytics
- `aggregated_music_data.json` - Comprehensive analytics in JSON format
- Multiple CSV files for specific analysis views
- Synthetic data enrichment (age demographics, genre classification)
